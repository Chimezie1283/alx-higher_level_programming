## Getting Started

To work on this project, you'll need to follow these general requirements:

- Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs for your code.
- All your files will be interpreted on Chrome (version 57.0).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should be semistandard compliant with the flag `--global $: semistandard *.js --global $`.
- You must use jQuery version 3.x.
- You are not allowed to use `var`.
- HTML should not reload for each action: DOM manipulation, updating values, fetching data.

### Importing jQuery

To use jQuery in your project, you can import it using the following script tag in your HTML file's `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
